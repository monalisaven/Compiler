# Compiler

Cimple is a small programming language, it is based on the C language, from which it derives ideas and structures, but it is significantly smaller.
The compiler is a program responsible for translating files written in Cimple language (.ci), in assembly language files (.asm).
This process is achieved by completing 6 stages: the verbal analysis, syntactic analysis, production of the intermediate code,
the construction of the symbol board, the semantic analysis and finally the production of the final code.
